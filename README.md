# Student-Performance-Analysis
*Overview*
This project investigates demographic, academic, and behavioral data to identify factors influencing student performance. By leveraging machine learning, the goal is to predict student outcomes and provide actionable recommendations for educational improvements.

**Objectives**

Analyze correlations between demographic and academic features.

Identify significant predictors of student performance.

Develop machine learning models to forecast academic outcomes.

Methodology

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing data by imputation.

Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generated correlation heatmaps to identify key factors.

Visualized data distributions with histograms and violin plots.

Feature Engineering:

Created composite metrics like attendance rate and study time.

Standardized numerical features for better model performance.

Machine Learning Models:

Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.

Evaluated models using cross-validation and accuracy scores.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Results & Insights

Parental education levels and attendance rates were significant predictors of performance.

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 89%.

Recommendations include interventions targeting low-performing demographics.
